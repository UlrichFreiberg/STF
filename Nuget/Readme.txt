To be able to run the Create-NugetPackage script you need to download the Nuget commandline tool from here:

https://dist.nuget.org/index.html

Place it "somewhere good" and add that location to your path variable (what Nuget says you should do).

Furthermore you'll need to set your API-key using the following command:

nuget setApiKey <API_KEY_THAT_YOU_RECEIVED_FROM_MIR_SOFTWARE_NUGET_MASTER>
