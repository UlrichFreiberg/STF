To be able to run the Create-NugetPackage script you need to download the Nuget commandline tool from here:

  https://dist.nuget.org/index.html

Place it "somewhere good" and add that location to your path variable (what Nuget says you should do).


Furthermore you'll need to set your API-key using the following command:

  nuget setApiKey <API_KEY> 

The api key is found in the Mir Software Nuget account on www.nuget.org.


The Nuget package Explorer is a tool that can be used to inspect Nuget packages. Find it here:
